Id: A unique identifier for each record. This column can be ignored during analysis as it does not provide useful information for model training.

Age: The age of the individual. This is an important feature as age can correlate with credit risk.

Income: The annual income of the individual. Higher incomes might correlate with lower credit risk.

Home: The home ownership status of the individual. This can be:

RENT: The individual is renting their home.
OWN: The individual owns their home outright.
MORTGAGE: The individual is paying a mortgage.
This feature can provide insight into the individual's financial stability.
Emp_length: Likely refers to the length of employment, which indicates job stability. Higher employment length might correlate with lower credit risk.

Intent: The purpose of the loan, which can be:

PERSONAL
EDUCATIONAL
MEDICAL
VENTURE
HOME IMPROVEMENT
DEBT CONSOLIDATION
This feature can help understand the risk associated with the loan's purpose.
Amount: The amount of money requested by the individual. Larger loan amounts might correlate with higher risk.

Rate: The interest rate charged on the loan. This can indicate the lender's perception of the individual's credit risk.

Status: This could indicate whether the loan was approved or not. If this is the case, it might not be useful for predicting default but could be relevant for understanding the dataset.

Percent_income: This likely represents the loan payment as a percentage of the individual's income. Higher percentages could indicate higher credit risk.

Default: Indicates whether the individual defaulted on the loan:

Y: Yes, the individual defaulted.
N: No, the individual did not default.
This is the target variable we want to predict.

Cred_length: Likely refers to the length of the individual's credit history in years. Longer credit histories might correlate with lower risk.
